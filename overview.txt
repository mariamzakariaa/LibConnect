Brief Description:

This project is a library management system that allows students to search, borrow, and 
return books using a Kaggle dataset stored in a CSV file. Structures manage book data (title, author, category, year, rating, availability), and students log in 
with encrypted IDs linked to their borrowed books. The system uses dynamic memory allocation, 2D arrays to track borrowed books per student, and file handling 
to persist data. Searching is primarily done via linear search, while top-rated book recommendations are managed using a circular linked list (RecNode) and 
can be efficiently navigated using jump search. Borrowed books are updated in real time, and the text-based menu (recursion) 
allows searching, borrowing, returning, and viewing books. Utility functions handle string cleaning, ID encryption/decryption, and consistent data processing.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Topics included:
1. Linear/Binary Search :
--> Binary Search: (students.cpp) Used in login() to check if the entered student ID exists in the sorted studentIDInts array.
--> Linear Search: (utils.cpp) used in findBookByISBN() to find a book by its ISBN for the borrowing history feature

2. Bubble Sorting:
--> (students.cpp) in sortDecrypted() for sorting studentIDInts array for binary search

3. 2D Arrays:
--> (main.cpp) the borrowedBooks[MAX_USERS][MAX_BORROWED] array for storing which student has borrowed.
--> (books.cpp) in handleBorrow(), showBorrowedBooks(), and returnBook() to track borrowed books per user.

4. Pointers and Dynamic Allocation:
--> (books.cpp) in parseField fuction for CSV parsing.
--> (main.cpp) dynamically allocated memory for books array.

5. Strings:
--> (utils.cpp) for ID encryption and decryption.
--> (books.cpp) for CSV field parsing in parseField function.
--> (search.cpp) for displaying and searching in books (by title or category, ...).
--> Used strcpy, strcat, strcmp, strncpy (string copy with limit) in multiple files too.

6. Recursion:
--> (main.cpp) the main menu calls itself until the user exits

7. Structures:
--> (books.h) (books.cpp) struct books stores book data and used in books functions in books.cpp

8. Files:
--> (books.cpp) 
	- loaded books.csv in loadBooks() and saved in saveBooks()
	- used borrowed.csv to append in saveBorrow(), read in loadUserBorrows(), update in removeBorrow() 

Extra Topics:
1. Linked Lists:
--> (recommendations.cpp) 
--> used a circular linked list (RecNode) to store top-rated books dynamically
--> nodes store pointers to book structures, enabling iteration through recommendations one by one and looping 
back to the first book.

2. Jump Search:
--> (recommendations.cpp)
--> searches through recommendations by jumping ahead in fixed steps and then performing a linear scan within blocks, 
providing a more efficient approach than plain linear search.
